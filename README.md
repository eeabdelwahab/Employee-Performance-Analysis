# Employee-Performance-Analysis
A data analysis project exploring employee performance, compensation, and departmental trends using SQL Excel and Power BI.
# Employee Performance Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee performance, salary, and departmental trends to help management identify performance patterns, compensation fairness, and potential areas of improvement.  
The analysis was carried out using *Excel* for data cleaning and descriptive statistics, and *Power BI* for interactive visualizations.

---

Business Objectives
- Understand how performance scores differ across departments and work modes.  
- Evaluate the relationship between compensation and employee performance.  
- Identify which departments or managers have the highest total compensation.  
- Compare salary and bonus distributions.  
- Provide insights and recommendations to improve workforce productivity and fairness.

 Project Structure
1. Data Import & Preparation
   - Collected data from multiple Excel sheets (employees, performance, salary, and work mode).  
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent data using Excel and Power Query.  
   - Standardized formats for dates, IDs, and department names.  

2. Exploration & Cleaning
   - Conducted summary statistics (mean, median, mode, skewness, kurtosis).  
   - Checked correlations between performance score and total compensation.  
   - Verified salary ranges and bonus percentages per department.

3. Key Analysis
   - Performance by work mode (Hybrid, Remote, On-site).  
   - Salary and bonus averages by department.  
   - Total compensation by manager.  
   - Distribution of performance levels (High, Medium, Low).  
   - Salary range and descriptive statistics overview.

4. Statistical Summary
   - Mean performance score: 3.21  
   - Standard deviation: 0.83
   - Correlation between performance and compensation: 0.035 (weak correlation)
   - Average salary across all departments: £35,532

5. Power BI Dashboard
   - KPIs for total employees, average performance, and total compensation.  
   - Interactive visuals for department comparison.  
   - Insights section summarizing findings and recommendations.

Findings
- Employee performance distribution is balanced, with most employees rated as Medium.  
- There is no strong correlation between performance and pay — higher compensation doesn’t necessarily lead to higher performance.  
- IT and R&D departments have the highest average salaries and bonuses.  
- Remote employees slightly outperform on-site employees in terms of performance score.  
- Managers Ahmed Khan and Priya Patel manage the highest total compensation.

---

Recommendations
- Review compensation strategies to ensure pay reflects performance impact.  
- Consider incentive-based programs for departments with lower performance.  
- Encourage flexible work arrangements — remote work shows slightly better results.  
- Regularly track performance KPIs and compensation fairness using this dashboard.

Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, descriptive statistics.  
- Power BI – Dashboard design, visuals, insights presentation.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to handle end-to-end data analytics — from cleaning and exploration to visualization and insight generation.  
The Power BI dashboard serves as a clear and data-driven decision-making tool for HR and management teams.
